1. Make tweet in reply to tweet
2. Run crontab on server once every hour
3. auto-exit node script
4. setup canned responses on gist.github.

=========

2. "you dont have it as bad as the driver"
3. Canned response is from Google Docs or text file ("https://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/") 
4. Gather drone data from an api (http://dronestre.am/) and tweet that (this is looking more likely)

5. Find out how to exit a node script

Problems, 
* Same tweet can't be sent twice (diversification)
* reply was initially not in direct response to the uber tweet
* tweets can be out of context (some people are just venting on how much  money they've spent)
*
